We chose the classes that represent concepts (either physical/specific or abstract/conceptual). Then, we organized them in taxonomies to define a superclass- subclass hierarchy.</span>
  <span class="markdown"> We decided that our focus had to be on the characters, so we defined the concept “Character” as a class, and then we created the subclasses from the sub-categories in which the characters are divided also in the text. In succession, we created the class “Name” since names’ etymology is a special point of interest in our project. Finally, we created the other classes: Place, Language and Weapon (with the internal sub-division by type that defined the subclasses).

After having created the classes, we disjointed them, so that an individual cannot be an instance of more than one of these classes. By doing so, we avoided the creation of different entities with the same name, even if they represent different individuals belonging to different classes, but we could have named them in the same way, only specifying in which classes they were. We defined some relationships that associate concepts, usually verbs end up as relations between two concepts. We also defined some properties, they are: aspects, properties, features, characteristics, or parameters that objects can have. We defined the relations, Object Properties, when the relationship is between two individuals, and the properties, Data Properties, when the relationship is between an individual and a primitive (String, Boolean, Integer and so on).

Then we put together the properties in relation to their Domain and Range. Finally, we created some elements or individuals, the instances that, in an ontology, represent objects in the domain in which we are interested.

We created some individuals for each class and we defined some formal axioms, to model sentences that are always true, giving properties and values to each individual. </span>
