<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
We created the LOTRO Ontology to share our knowledge with other users that could be interested in the topics we covered. Ontologies are useful in order to share some gained knowledge not only with other users, but also with software agents. As a matter of fact, one of the main important features of the ontologies is that they are written in a MRF (Machine Readable Form). However, LOTRO takes a sample of 11 characters appearing in the first book of the trilogy, <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> and tries to build a knowledge graph representing the kind of relationships existing between those characters. Therefore, one can see relationships such as "adoption", friendOf", "enemyOf", but also something more specific and related to our linguistic analysis, namely, the etymology of the names and the meaning that each of them carries.</span>
